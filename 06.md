## Chapter 6.

### Exercise 6.01

How does the recursive version of the factorial function behave if applied to a
negative argument, such as `(-1)`? Modify the definition to prohibit negative
arguments by adding a guard to the recursive case.

### Solution

The function will continue forever, since `fac 0` will never be reached.

```haskell
fac :: Int -> Int
fac 0         = 1
fac n | n > 0 = n * fac (n - 1)
```

### Exercise 6.02

Define a recursive function `sumdown :: Int -> Int` that returns the sum of the
non-negative integers from a given value down to zero. For example, `sumdown 3`
should return the result `3+2+1+0 = 6`.

### Solution

```haskell
sumdown :: Int -> Int
sumdown 0 = 0
sumdown x = x + sumdown (x - 1)
```

### Exercise 6.03

Define the exponentiation operator `^` for non-negative integers using the same
pattern of recursion as the multiplication operator `*`, and show how the
expression `2 ^ 3` is evaluated using your definition.

### Solution

```haskell
(^) :: Int -> Int -> Int
_ ^ 0 = 1
x ^ y = x * (x ^ (y - 1))


2 ^ 3                   -- apply ^
2 * (2 ^ 2)             -- apply ^
2 * (2 * (2 ^ 1))       -- apply ^
2 * (2 * (2 * (2 ^ 0))) -- apply ^
2 * (2 * (2 * 1))       -- apply *
2 * (2 * 2)             -- apply *
2 * 4                   -- apply *
8
```

### Exercise 6.04

Define a recursive function `euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int` that implements
*Euclid's algorithm* for calculating the greates common divisor of two
non-negative integers: if the two numbers are equal, this number is the result;
otherwise, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger, and the same
process is repeated. For example:

```
> euclid 6 27
3
```

### Solution

```haskell
euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int
euclid x y | x == y = x
           | x >  y = euclid (x-y) y
           | x <  y = euclid x (y-x)
```
