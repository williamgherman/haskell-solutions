## Chapter 3.

### Exercise 3.01

What are the types of the following values?

```
['a', 'b', 'c']
('a', 'b', 'c')
[(False, '0'), (True, '1')]
([False, True], ['0', '1'])
[tail, init, reverse]
```

### Solution

```haskell
['a', 'b', 'c']             :: [Char] -- or String
('a', 'b', 'c')             :: (Char, Char, Char)
[(False, '0'), (True, '1')] :: [(Bool, Char)]
([False, True], ['0', '1']) :: ([Bool], [Char]) -- or ([Bool], String)
[tail, init, reverse]       :: [[a] -> [a]]
```

### Exercise 3.02

Write down definitions that have the following types; it does not matter what
the definitions actually do as long as they are type correct.

```haskell
bools :: [Bool]
nums :: [[Int]]
add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
copy :: a -> (a,a)
apply :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
```

### Solution

```haskell
bools :: [Bool]
bools = [True]

nums :: [[Int]]
nums = [[1]]

add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
add x y z = x + y + z

copy :: a -> (a,a)
copy x = (x,x)

apply :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
apply f a = f a
```
### Exercise 3.03

What are the types of the following functions?

```haskell
second xs = head (tail xs)
swap (x,y) = (y,x)
pair x y = (x,y)
double x = x*2
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs
twice f x = f (f x)
```

Hint: take care to include the necessary class constraints in the types if the
functions are defined using overloaded operators.

### Solution

```haskell
second :: [a] -> [a]
second xs = head (tail xs)

swap :: (a,b) -> (b,a)
swap (x,y) = (y,x)

pair :: a -> b -> (a,b)
pair x y = (x,y)

double :: Num a => a -> a
double x = x*2

palindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs

twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)
```
